1. What is the complexity of your algorithm (in big O notation)?
 Placing ship on the grid with the number of ships, generatings pairs and iterating through them to have them positioned next to each other.

2. How would you improve your algorithm?
 instead of placing ships randomly, I could create a method to automatically generate the pairs closer together.

3. How would your adapt your algorithm to three dimensions? How would that affect
the complexity?
